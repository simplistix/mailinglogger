MailingLogger documentation
===========================

This package provides more flexible and powerful email log handling for
python's standard logging framework. 

Two log handlers are provided:

:doc:`MailingLogger <mailinglogger>`
   This mails out appropriate log entries as they are emitted.

:doc:`SummarisingLogger <summarisinglogger>`
   This mails out a summary of all appropriate log entries at the end
   of the running python script.

.. warning::

  The only caveat for using this package is that the SMTP server you
  are using must be fast. Email is sent via SMTP and, if using a
  :class:`~mailinglogger.MailingLogger`, at the time the message is
  logged. If your SMTP server is slow, your application's performance
  may suffer.
