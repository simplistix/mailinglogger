API Reference
=============

.. currentmodule:: mailinglogger

.. autoclass:: MailingLogger
  :show-inheritance:

  This is a handler for the python logging framework that
  sends log entries as email messages using an SMTP server.

  :param fromaddr:

    The address from which email log notifications will originate.

    This must be supplied.

  :param toaddrs:

    A sequence of addresses to which email log notifications will be
    sent.

    This must be supplied.

  :param mailhost:

    The SMTP server that should be used to send email notifications. 
  
    This can either be a string containing the hostname of the SMTP
    server or a tuple containing the hostname and port number of the
    SMTP server. If only the hostname is specified, it is assumed that
    the SMTP server is listening on port 25.

    default: ``('localhost', 25)``

  :param username:

    The username to use for SMTP authentication.

    If both username and password are supplied then SMTP login will
    be performed before any email is sent. Otherwise, no SMTP
    authentication will be performed. For performance reasons, it's
    recommended that you don't use SMTP authentication unless you
    absolutely need to.

  :param password:

    The password to use for SMTP authentication.

    If both username and password are supplied then SMTP login will
    be performed before any email is sent. Otherwise, no SMTP
    authentication will be performed. For performance reasons, it's
    recommended that you don't use SMTP authentication unless you
    absolutely need to.

  :param subject: 

    This is a format string specifying what information will be
    included in the subject line of the email notification.

    Information on what can be included in a subject format string can
    be found in the :doc:`subjectformatter` documentation.

    default: ``'%(line)s'``

  :param send_empty_entries:

    This is a boolean parameter which specifies whether empty log
    entries will be mailed or not. 

    default: ``False``

  :param flood_level:

    This is an integer parameter specifying the maximum number of
    emails that can be sent in an hour that will not be considered a
    "flood". 

    When a "flood" is detected, one email is sent at the CRITICAL
    level indicating that a flood has been detected, and no more
    emails will be sent in the same hour.

    So, this option, in effect, specifies the maximum number of
    emails that will be sent in any particular hour of the day.

    default: ``10``

  :param headers:

    This is a dictionary containing headers and their values to be
    added to any emails sent.
   
    default: ``{}``

  :param template:

    A string template to use to wrap the body of emails sent.
    Should contain exactly one ``%s``.
   
    default: ``None``

  :param charset:

    The charset passed to :class:`~email.mime.text.MIMEText` when the
    message logged is a :class:`unicode` instance.
   
    default: ``utf-8``

    ..  note:: This parameter is *only* used when a :class:`unicode`
               object is logged. The default will amost always
               suffice, do not pass this parameter unless you really
               need to.

  :param content_type:

    The content type to use when setting the ``Content-Type`` header
    on any email sent. Only content types of ``text/`` are supported.
   
    default: ``text/plain``

.. autoclass:: SummarisingLogger
  :show-inheritance:

  SummarisingLogger is a handler for the python logging framework that
  accumulates logged entries and sends a single email containing them
  all using an SMTP server when :meth:`~SummarisingLogger.close` called.

  :param fromaddr:

    The address from which the summary email will originate.

    This must be supplied.

  :param toaddrs:

    A sequence on strings containing  addresses to which the summary
    email will be sent. 

    This must be supplied.

  :param mailhost:

    The SMTP server that should be used to send the summary mail. 
  
    This can either be a string containing the hostname of the SMTP
    server or a tuple containing the hostname and port number of the
    SMTP server. If only the hostname is specified, it is assumed that
    the SMTP server is listening on port 25.

    default: ``('localhost', 25)``

  :param username:

    The username to use for SMTP authentication.

    If both username and password are supplied then SMTP login will
    be performed before any email is sent. Otherwise, no SMTP
    authentication will be performed. For performance reasons, it's
    recommended that you don't use SMTP authentication unless you
    absolutely need to.

  :param password:

    The password to use for SMTP authentication.

    If both username and password are supplied then SMTP login will
    be performed before any email is sent. Otherwise, no SMTP
    authentication will be performed. For performance reasons, it's
    recommended that you don't use SMTP authentication unless you
    absolutely need to.

  :param subject:

    This is a format string specifying what information will be
    included in the subject line of the summary email.

    Information on what can be included in a subject format string can
    be found in the :doc:`subjectformatter` documentation.

    .. note:: 

        ``%(levelname)s`` when used in the `subject` parameter will be the
        highest level message handled by the :class:`SummarisingLogger`.

    default: ``'Summary of Log Messages (%(levelname)s)'``

  :param send_empty_entries:

    This is a boolean parameter which specifies whether a summary
    message will be sent even if no messages have been logged.

    default: ``True``

  :param atexit:

    If True, the :meth:`~SummarisingLogger.close` method of the
    summarising logger is set as an :mod:`atexit` function that runs when the
    currently executing python script finishes.

    default: ``True``

  :param headers:

    This is a dictionary containing headers and their values to be
    added to any emails sent.
   
    default: ``{}``

  :param send_level:

    If supplied, the summary email will not be sent unless a message
    has been logged that is at or above the level specified.
   
    If not supplied, the summary email will be sent if a message has
    been logged at or above the level set on the handler.
   
    default: None

  :param template:

    A string template to use to wrap the body of the summary email.
    Should contain exactly one ``%s``.
   
    default: ``None``

  :param charset:

    This string value has two uses. 

    Firstly, it is used to encode the messages logged to the summary
    and then decode the whole summary back to unicode when the summary
    is sent.

    Secondlly, if that unicode message cannot be encoded as ``ascii``,
    it is passed to the :class:`~email.mime.text.MIMEText` used to
    produce the summary email.
   
    default: ``utf-8``

    .. note:: This default will amost always suffice, do not pass this
              parameter unless you really need to.

  :param content_type:

    The content type to use when setting the ``Content-Type`` header
    on any email sent. Only content types of ``text/`` are supported.
   
    default: ``text/plain``

  :param flood_level:

    The maximum number of messages that can be logged before flood
    protection begins. Flood protection prevents overly large emails
    being sent by excluding exccess messages. When this occurs, a
    CRITICAL level message will be included detailing the number of
    messages excluded. The last 5 messages logged before the email is
    sent will always be included.
   
    default: ``100``

  .. method:: open()

    This method creates the temporary file used by
    :class:`SummarisingLogger` to accumulate logged messages and
    enables it for processing of log messages.

  .. method:: close()

    This method closes the temporary file used by
    :class:`SummarisingLogger` to accumulate logged messages and sends
    any logged messages in a single email.

    It also disables the :class:`SummarisingLogger`'s processing of
    log messages.

  .. method:: reopen()

    This is shorthand for calling :meth:`~SummarisingLogger.close`
    followed by :meth:`~SummarisingLogger.open`.

.. autoclass:: mailinglogger.common.SubjectFormatter
  :show-inheritance:

  This is a `logging formatter`__ tailored to formatting log messages
  to appear in the subject line of an email. For details of how these
  differ from normal :class:`~logging.Formatter` objects, see the
  :doc:`subjectformatter` documentation.

  __ http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#formatter-objects

  .. note:: 

    You should not need to manually instantiate this class as this
    will be done by either :class:`MailingLogger` or
    :class:`SummarisingLogger` when the `subject` parameter to their
    constructors is processed.

.. autoclass:: mailinglogger.common.HTMLFilter

  This is a `logging filter`__ that quotes logged messages such that
  they are safe for use in HTML emails. For an example usage, see 
  :doc:`html`.
